### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to verify different conditions to see under which a WR star can efficiently be spun up by tides to achieve high-spinning BH remnants. <br>

### Contents overview
- The code itself is based on a series of tasks given to me as worksheets, with the functions, ODE_solver and plot_utils files being intended for future, unrelated use as well. <br>
- The MAIN,main_worksheet and plot_testing files are trial files which will not be updated regularly, but the calculations written in them may be reused.<br>
- main_condition_checker is intended to output a table into a separate file with all initial data that fullfils the condition(s) currently being verified.<br>
- main_eq_plots serves as a plotter for the solutions of the ODE I am working with. It is possible that more conditions will be added to it to decrease the amount of output.<br>
- main_worksheet_population_study and main_worksheet_BH_binary are the subsequent tasks of the worksheet, which focus on the dimentionless spin parameter and the effective spin.<br>
